In this project, I have created a group repository that contains a few members which are proxy repositories and a local repository for saving developed local images in Nexus private repository, so, that users can pull and push images from local or proxy repositories and also connect to Nexus web interface, I created a reverse proxy nginx config for a single URL address on a single port number.
